[MLVDE](https://github.com/MLVDE) is a free, open-source, cross-platform
[virtual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop) [desktop
environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) for the [X
window system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) built around
the [MLVWM](https://github.com/morgant/mlvwm) [window
manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager).

_It is a study of the early history and evolution of the [graphical user
interface (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interfaces)
through the lens of [Apple Inc.](https://www.apple.com/)'s (née [Apple Computer,
Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.#History)) classic [Mac
OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS), which helped popularize
GUIs and the desktop metaphor._

## Imitation is the Sincerest Form of Flattery

The [intention](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intention) of the **MLVDE**
project is a threefold [study](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/study) of — and
[meditation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meditation) on — the **Mac OS**
GUI, the [**X** protocols and
architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System_protocols_and_architecture),
and the [**Unix philosophy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
through an accurate recreation and adaptation of the Macintosh System 6
through Mac OS 9. Through this interpretation and implementation of the Mac OS
user interface, we hope to preserve and extend the ability for it to be
experienced on modern computers.

**TO REITERATE, REPEAT, REINSTATE:** MLVDE is a not-for-profit _academic and
artistic study_, for educational purposes, of the now decades-discontinued Mac
OS user interface, many elements of which remain under the copyright of Apple
Inc. MLVDE _is not_ Mac OS. MLVDE _is not a product of_ Apple Inc. MLVDE
_is not associatated with nor endorsed by_ Apple Inc.

## Project Goals

* Implement the overall user interface elements and appearance of Macintosh
  System 6 through Mac OS 9, including:
    * System 6 (monochrome)
    * System 7 (color)
    * Mac OS 8/9 (a.k.a. 'Platinum'; color)
* Adhere to POSIX, [X.org](https://x.org/), and [freedesktop.org](https://www.freedesktop.org/)
  standards and specifications
* Light-weight implementation with both memory and processor efficiency in
  mind (hopefully it _could_ be compiled and perform adequately on period-
  correct hardware)
* Implement in period-correct C89, wherever possible
* Write good code and keep security in mind
* Utilize modern X extensions where appropriate, while providing either
  fallbacks _or_ a reduced feature set
* Use/write small(er) utilities that do one (or just a few) things well, with
  interoperability when appropriate
* Provide a user-friendly out-of-the-box experience without preventing
  customization and/or substitution of utilities for user preference
* Add and/or adapt functionality/technology which didn't exist at the time,
  trying to be consistent with original goals, concepts, and guidelines
  (i.e. ask yourself, _"If [this] had existed in 1998, how would Apple's
  designers and developers implemented/integrated it?"_)
* Document the System 6 through Mac OS 9 UI/UX from a historical preservation
  aspect **and** how it relates to and/or can be adapted to current use and
  technologies

## Sub Projects

* [MLVWM](https://github.com/morgant/mlvwm) (ML Virtual Window Manager)
* [mlvwmrc](https://github.com/morgant/mlvwmrc) (MLVWM configuration)
* [mlclock](https://hithub.com/morgant/mlclock) (ML menu bar clock)
* ...

## What Does MLVDE Stand For?

MLVDE is built around preserving and updating the [MLVWM](https://github.com/morgant/mlvwm)
window manager. 'MLVWM' was originally an acronym for "Macintosh-Like Virtual
Window Manager." As 'Macintosh' is a trademark of Apple Inc., we are removing
any specific meaning for 'ML' and so 'MLVWM' and 'MLVDE' are acronyms for
"'ML' Virtual Window Manager" and "'ML' Virtual Desktop Environment",
respectively.

While 'ML' no longer has any official meaning, you're welcome to use any
appropriate mnemonic devices to remember it by. We suggest "minimal
and light-weight" (a goal of the project) or "masters level" (relating to the
academic research/study aspect of the project.)
